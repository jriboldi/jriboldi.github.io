Methodology
-------

#### Estimate of decorrelation time
Decorrelation time $\tau$ is estimated from an exponential fit of the autocorrelation function A, computed for each wavenumber/phase speed harmonic during the 90 DJF days in each winter. 
Approximating A as an exponential, 

$A=A_0 e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}}$

where here $\tau$ corresponds the time needed for the autocorrelation function to drop from 1 to $1/e$. A was computed between lag 0 ($A_0$=1) and lag +5 days, meaning that 6 points are employed to fit $\tau$. If A becomes negative before lag +5 already, only the available positive values are used to fit the exponential.

Mean decorrelation times were estimated for each winter season and then averaged to obtain the plot in the poster. A broad range of $\tau$ values was obtained across the considered winters, indicating different persistence scales of the same harmonic across different seasons.


#### Spectral analysis
Focusing on a latitude $\phi$, an Hovmoeller diagram of meridional wind anomalies V' at 250 hPa is built over a time period of two months (61 days). Zonal wavenumbers are obtained from spectral decomposition along the longitude dimension, while frequencies are obtained from V' variability along the time dimension. Interpolation to the phase speed is possible using the Rossby wave dispersion relationship $c_p=\omega/k$, as in [Randel and Held (1991)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/48/5/1520-0469_1991_048_0688_pssote_2_0_co_2.xml). This procedure is repeated for each latitude circle between 35°N and 75°N: the obtained spectra are then averaged to obtain one representative of the whole mid- to high latitudes. 

This same procedure is also repeated for every two-month time window centered on each day between the 1st of February 1979 and the 30th of November 2018: results of this work only use spectra obtained during boreal winter days (DJF).

(2020)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020GL087796) or, for an open-access alternative, the Data and Methods section of our recently submitted [WCDD paper](https://wcd.copernicus.org/preprints/wcd-2021-59).

#### Event extraction 
The area-weighted fraction of grid points occupied by atmospheric blocking in the Northern Hemisphere is computed for each winter day between December 1979 and February 2018. Blocking is defined following the [Schwierz et al. (2004)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2003GL019341) anomaly-based approach. 

The days corresponding to the top and bottom 10% of blocked area are selected separately for each season: this leads to the selection of 9+9 days per season, for a total of 351 days in each subset. The corresponding anomalies in spectral power with respect to the DJF mean are averaged to build composites. In case more than 9 days in a season did not feature any blocking, a subset of nine of is chosen at random.

**Do North Pacific and North Atlantic blocks have a different spectral signature? Is it possible to distinguish between them?** 
Sensitivity of the composites to the choice of the averaging region is assessed by considering two averaging boxes focusing on blocking occurrence at the end of the North Atlantic (80°W-0°E,40°N-70°N) and North Pacific (180°W-120°W,40°N-70°N) storm tracks. Events of large blocked area over the whole Northern Hemisphere feature blocking at the end of the two storm tracks (Fig. 1a). Selecting for single storm tracks isolates the blocking frequency anomalies over the chosen sector: days of high blocked area over the North Atlantic are associated with an average blocking activity over the North Pacific, and vice versa (Figs. 1b,c). This allows, in principle, for the identification of blocking's spectral characteristics in a single storm track, with minimum contamination coming from blocking activity in the other one.
