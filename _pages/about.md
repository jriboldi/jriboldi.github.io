Welcome to my personal page!

I am currently a Postdoctoral researcher in Atmospheric and Climate Sciences at the University of Uppsala, in Sweden. Before starting this new experience, I have been PostDoc at the Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique in Paris until February 2021. I obtained my doctorate in Atmospheric Dynamics at [ETH Zurich](https://iac.ethz.ch/group/atmospheric-dynamics.html) in February 2018. 

In my research I try to tackle climate change issues from a **weather system perspective**, grounded in synoptic meteorology. In this view, cyclones and anticyclones are the building blocks of the daily evolution of the weather and, on the long run, of the climate. Understanding the characteristics and variability of weather systems can cast light on long-term climate trends and help to better predict the extreme weather events caused by anthropogenic global warming.

*Depression Dennis reached a minimum pressure of 920.5 hPa on 16 February 2020, making it one of the most intense extratropical cyclones observed in the North Atlantic. In this loop we see the two stages of its development. A first pressure minimum, indicated by the black bold contours (every 10hPa, only contours below 990 hPa are shown) develops to the east of an upper-level trough that crosses the Atlantic from Canada, indicated in blue (bold blue lines represent 250hPa geopotential height in dam, colors indicate the geopotential anomaly at the same level with respect to the monthly mean of February 2020). This phase-locking leads to the development of a deep cyclone, but it is not yet the end: a second pressure minimum develops near the southern edge of the circulation and travels cyclonically around the old one, rapidly deepening and becoming the dominant one. This second pressure minimum will reach, in the night between the 15 and the 16 Feburary 2020, the absolute sea level pressure minimum while located south of Iceland. Data from ERA5.*
