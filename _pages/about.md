Welcome to my personal page!

I am a researcher in Atmospheric and Climate Sciences at the Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique, in Paris. I obtained my doctorate in Atmospheric Dynamics at [ETH Zurich](https://iac.ethz.ch/group/atmospheric-dynamics.html) in February 2018. 

In my research I try to tackle climate change issues from a **weather system perspective**, grounded in synoptic meteorology. In this view, cyclones and anticyclones are the building blocks of the daily evolution of the weather and, on the long run, of the climate. Understanding the characteristics and variability of weather systems can cast light on long-term climate trends and help to better describe and predict the extreme weather events caused by anthropogenic global warming.
